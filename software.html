        <h3>Value Network Software</h3>
        <p>
        This is our current focus and priority. Still working with Sensorica, with two other networks getting ready to go.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork" target="_blank">Github repository</a></li>

        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Local Economic Development Software</h3>
        <p>
        This one is waiting for the next interested user groups, but the model is pretty much the same as the Value Network Software. 
        This software could be a higher level view of the Value Network. That idea was proposed by a group in Nova Scotia that, 
        unfortunately, fell apart. Netention, our currently active software partner, also proposed the idea independently.

        </p>
        
        <h3>Food Network Software</h3>
        <p>
        We haven't worked on this one for awhile. Two food networks are still using it. A couple of others are looking at it. 
        If they want it, it's open source, they can use it. But if they want a lot of changes, we would be better off making 
        our new Value Network software work for food networks, which it could do.

            <li><a href="http://foodnetworksoftware.org/" target="_blank">Demo site</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>REA: the model behind all our software</h3>
        <p>
        REA stands for Resources, Events and Agents. It is the ISO economic and accounting standard. It can handle any 
        economic relationships in Internet commerce. We've extended it to handle Value Networks and ecological requirements. 
        A lot to read about it in this <a href="https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork/wiki" target="_blank">Github wiki</a>.
        And here's an earlier article about <a href="http://www.group-accounting.com/neweconomy" target="_blank">Accounting for a new economy</a>.

        <h3>Why traditional ERP and accounting software won't work for networks</h3>
        <p>
        The problems we've seen include:
        <ul>
        <li>Internal focus: ERP software is focused on "the corporation". They add other systems to deal with their supply chains, which usually means only their 
        direct suppliers. And then still other software to deal with their customers, but only their direct customers. A network is seamless, from end 
        to end and side to side. Everybody is equal, and plays different roles: supplier in this relationship, customer in this one, creator in another.</li>
        <li>Distributing income according to contributions, with no profit for the owner. (Or, no owner at all!) Who gets what? How do you track contributions? 
        What about different skills? Do you reward time or deliverables? How to rate deliverable quality? Totally foreign to ERP software.</li>
        <li>Practical problems of administration, some that are not handled by programs like QuickBooks, and some that are not handled by very expensive ERP software.
        Distributed inventory with different owners. Following value flows through many parties. Lot tracking for food and medicines. 
        (ERP does the last, QB don't, we do. Neither ERP nor QB can follow value flows, and distributed inventory is iffy.)
        </li>
        <li>Transparency and trust, where members of the network want to know the overall shape and often the details of the value flows inside 
        and around the network. In particular, each member wants to know all of the details of value flows affecting them.</li>
        <li>Resource ownership, management, and sharing. Who owns or manages what? Who can use it? Under what conditions? With what compensation?</li>
        <li>Coordination without command-and-control hierarchies.</li>
        </ul>
        Solutions to the administrative and coordination problems are necessary for an economic group to work at all. 
        Solutions to the transparency and trust problems are necessary for the group to survive and prosper, or often to get organized in the first place.
        Solutions to the income distribution and resource sharing problems are necessary to avoid losing contributors.
        And if you are focused only on yourself, you are not even a network.
        </p>
        <p>We wrote a much longer article about these problems in the context of food networks in 2009:
