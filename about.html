        <h3>The core team</h3>
        <p>The core development team lives among the woods and small farms of rural southwest Wisconsin, USA.  
        We don't have much cell phone coverage, but we do have very good internet! We are helped by a few others...  
        </p>
        <p>We are trying to use the skills we have to respond to the times we find ourselves in, with
        potential crises in the economy, climate change, and peak resources.  We think we are in a transitional time,
        ....  There are lots of experiments going on...</p>
        <p>We have several decades between us of software development experience, including ...  manufacturing...
        </p>
        
        <h3>What we have done so far</h3>
        <p>We started out creating software for local networks - three food networks and a timber network close to us. ... 
        We also did something for a co-housing group.  ....
        </p>
        <p>Currently we are working with Sensorica of Montreal, CA, a peer to peer ....
        </p>
        <p>It is not easy to organize alternate or new and fair economic groups.  We try to make it easier by 
        providing the operational, accounting, and administrative help people need.  Plus we want to make it so that
        different networks or groups can interact with each other, forming networks of networks.
        </p>
        <h3>Our mascot, Mushy the chanterelle mushroom</h3>

        <p>
        Chanterelles are mycorrhizal mushrooms.
        </p>

        <p>
        Mycorrhizal mushrooms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants, where the mycorrhizae help the plants get food from the soil, and the plants help the mycorrhizae get food from the sun.
        </p>

        <p>
        Back in the Devonian age, when ocean plants started to colonize the land, they would not have been able to do so without forming relationships with mycorrhizal fungi that were already there.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Think of this as the Devonian age of a humane economy.</b>
