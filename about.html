            <h4>The core team</h4>
            <p>The core development team lives among the woods and small farms of rural southwest Wisconsin, USA.  
            We don't have much cell phone coverage, but we do have very good internet! We are helped by a few others located
            around the world. 
            </p>
            <p>The networks who use the software also help us create it. For example, the Value Network Software (NRP) 
            was designed by Sensorica as much as the programmers.
            </p>
            <p>We are trying to use the skills we have to respond to the times we find ourselves in, with
            crises in the economy, climate change, and peak resources.</p>  
            <p>There are lots of experiments going on all over to address the problems we all see.  We want to help
            groups of people who are trying out alternate economic forms that are more fair.  These economic groups
            tend to be networks, or at least they want to network with other similar groups.</p>
            <p>They also
            usually need some operational infrastructure to make their work more productive, and existing software options
            don't really work well for these groups.  We think we can help out.</p>
            <p>We have quite a few decades of software development experience, in all kinds of industries, but especially
            in manufacturing supply chains. Supply chains, in fact, are economic networks. They are just not yet next-economy networks.

            <h4>How we work</h4>
            <p>We work off a hypothesis that has 5 parts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We as a species are headed into a systemic crisis. That is, the current global economic system is failing.</li>
                <li>The next system could be much better or much worse.</li>
                <li>The much-better version will be networked, and will require better software.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork/wiki/Concepts">REA (Resource-Event-Agent) model</a> 
                (aka the 
                <a href="http://jtc1sc32.org/doc/N1051-1100/32N1083-CD15944-4-wg1n266.pdf">ISO standard Economic and Accounting Ontology</a>) 
                is an appropriate base model for such software.</li>
                <li>We don't know in detail how such software must work, so we will learn how by working with existing economic networks 
                that are trying to change the economic system. We look at this as a series of semi-scientific experiments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of such experiments <a href="groups.html">here</a></p>
            
            <h4>For potential collaborators</h4>
            <p>In addition to new user networks, we're interested in collaborating with other software projects who see themselves as 
            part of the same set of solutions, and would jump on opportunities to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>We don't think it is possible to do by ourselves all that is required. We are conducting conversations about 
            developing a common vocabulary and model for collaborating software 
            <a href="https://github.com/openvocab/ovn">here</a>. The more the merrier.
            </p>
            <p>And we are also interested in working with other programmers, designers, writers, whatever. Here are some of 
            <a href="https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork/wiki/Help" target="_blank">our current needs for direct help.</a>

            <h4>Our mascot, Mushy the chanterelle mushroom</h4>
            <div>
                <img class="img-right-margin pull-left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Cantharellus_cibarius.jpg"  width="300" height="225" />
                <p>
                Chanterelles are mycorrhizal mushrooms.  (We would have used that as our name, but who can spell it?)
                </p>
                <p>
                Mycorrhizal mushrooms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants, where the mycorrhizae help the plants get food from the soil, and the plants help the mycorrhizae get food from the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                Back in the Devonian age, when ocean plants started to colonize the land, they would not have been able to do so without forming relationships with mycorrhizal fungi that were already there.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Think of this as the Devonian age of the next economy.</b>
