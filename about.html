            <h3>The core team</h3>
            <p>The core development team lives among the woods and small farms of rural southwest Wisconsin, USA.  
            We don't have much cell phone coverage, but we do have very good internet! We are helped by a few others located
            around the world.
            </p>
            <p>We are trying to use the skills we have to respond to the times we find ourselves in, with
            crises in the economy, climate change, and peak resources.</p>  
            <p>There are lots of experiments going on all over to address the problems we all see.  We want to help
            groups of people who are trying out alternate economic forms that are more fair.  These economic groups
            tend to be networks, or at least they want to network with other similar groups.</p>
            <p>They also
            usually need some operational infrastructure to make their work more productive, and existing software options
            don't really work well for these groups.  We think we can help out.</p>
            <p>We have quite a few decades of software development experience, in all kinds of industries, but especially
            in manufacturing supply chains.  There have been lots of stages in supply chain software, which we know well.
            Supply chains, in fact, are economic networks. They are not yet next-economy networks.

            <h3>For potential collaborators</h3>
            <p>We're interested in collaborating with other software projects who see themselves as potentially 
            part of the same set of solutions, and would jump on opportunities to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>We don't think it is possible to do all that is required by ourselves.</p>
            <p>Currently we are actively working with <a href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Netention">Netention</a>, 
            and talking to <a href="https://www.loomio.org/">Loomio</a> and <a href="http://www.getlocal.coop/">Get Local</a> 
            about it.
            </p>
            <p>And we are also interested in working with other programmers, designers, writers, whatever. Here are some of

            <div>
                <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Cantharellus_cibarius.jpg"  width="300" height="225" style="float: left; margin-right: 6px;" />
                <p>
                Chanterelles are mycorrhizal mushrooms.  (We would have used that as our name, but who can spell it?)
                </p>
                <p>
                Mycorrhizal mushrooms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants, where the mycorrhizae help the plants get food from the soil, and the plants help the mycorrhizae get food from the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                Back in the Devonian age, when ocean plants started to colonize the land, they would not have been able to do so without forming relationships with mycorrhizal fungi that were already there.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Think of this as the Devonian age of a humane economy.</b>
