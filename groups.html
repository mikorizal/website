      <h3>Timber! (in more ways than one...)</h3>
      <p>
      We started this project with a group of timber growers, loggers, sawyers and woodworkers in Wisconsin. 
      The system worked exactly the way that timber processes work. 
      <p>
      
      <img src="https://sites.google.com/site/economicgroups/_/rsrc/1229534428237/Home/DocsAndImages/TimberProcesses.png">
      
      <p>
      We thought the group had a good business plan, and we thought the software was excellent.  In particular, 
      the software did manufacturing cost accounting much better and simpler than most expensive packaged software. 
      We were very proud of it, and the timber group loved it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      </p>
      Unfortunately, the group fell apart (having nothing to do with the software, and everything to do with business disagreements).  
      But if another timber group is interested, we would be happy to revive the software. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Food networks</h3>
      <p>
      We got a request from a woman in Minnesota who was running a local food network. She was also a single parent, taking care of 
      <i>her</i> parents, running a herd of dairy cows, and making cheese. Needless to say, she was going a little crazy...
      </p>
      <div class="pull-left">  
      <img class="pull-left img-right-margin" src="http://foodnetworksoftware.org/site_media/images/SMFN_administrator.jpg" height="175" width="250" />
     
        <p>
        She wanted administrative software. And she knew exactly how it should work. So we made it work that way.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, 4 other food networks have used the software, which has continuously improved from their ideas. 
        Two of the five are still using the software, two died (again nothing to do with the software), and another got an investor who did not like open source. 
        This stuff is hard! 
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyway, here's <a href="http://foodnetworksoftware.org/" target="_blank">some information about the software</a>. We have not worked on it for awhile. 
        Lots of new people are doing food network and food hub software now, vs nobody when we started. We prefer to solve 
        unsolved problems. Three other groups are looking at the software now, though, so if any of them wants, we'll 
        work on it again. Or rather we'll make our new Value Network software work for food networks. It's better.

      <h3>Local economic analysis</h3>
      
      <img class="img-right-margin" src="http://locecon.org/site_media/images/to-be.jpg" width="600" height="350" />
      <img src="images/FisheriesMapsCrop.jpg" width=462 height="300"/>
      
      <p>
      We started this project with help from <a href="http://www.crcworks.org/crossroads/?submit=about" target="_blank">Ken Meter of the Crossroads Resource Center</a>, 
      the best local economic analyst we have ever met. But it really came alive when these guys who represented a cooperative of small fishing boats 
      in Nova Scotia got ahold of it. They wanted to plan a better distribution system for sustainably caught fish, networked throughout the province. </p>
      <p>You can read about them 
      <a href="http://locecon.org/nova-story/" target="_blank">here</a> and get the software <a href="https://github.com/bhaugen/localecon" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h3>Open Value Networks</h3>
      <div class="pull-left">
        <iframe  class="pull-left" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ixgp8_B9g5A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>
        The term Value Network, as far we know, was coined by <a href="http://www.vernaallee.com/" target="_blank">Verna Allee</a>. The Open part 
        was added by <a href="http://www.sensorica.co/" target="_blank">Sensorica</a>. We've been working with them on our latest 
        (and we think greatest) software project for the past year and a half. You can see it in action 
        <a href="http://valnet.webfactional.com" target="_blank">here</a> and get the software <a href="https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.sensorica.co/" target="_blank">Sensorica</a> open value network comes out of the global trend
        towards open source hardware and commons-based peer to peer (P2P) production experiments. Their intention is to 
        provide an interface where anyone in the world can contribute virtually to their R&amp;D and manufacturing efforts, and get rewarded
        for their contributions in proportion to their work.
        </p>
        <p>
        We're also working with two other groups who want to use the same software: the <a href="http://guerrillatranslation.com/" target="_blank">Guerrilla Media Collective</a> 
        of Spain, and the <a href="http://valdev.webfactional.com" target="_blank">Tanzania Innovation Portfolio</a>.  Working
        with more than one value network at a time has allowed us to further generalize the software.
