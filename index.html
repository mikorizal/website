            <h4>Network operational software</h4>
            <p>This software is currently known as NRP/VAS for Network Resource Planning / Value Accounting System.
            It is operational software for peer-to-peer networks that are creating something and
            experimenting with different economic relationships. So this could be open value networks, 
            food networks, worker cooperatives, and others.  Could even be small business ecosystems.</p>   
            <p>It involves defining the network, planning the requirements, coordinating the work, and
            democratically sharing the benefits.</p>

            <h4>Regional economic ecosystem analysis</h4>
            <p>This software works on the same resource flow model as the operational software, except at the next level up.
            It can be used for local and regional economic planning, identification of problems in the resource flows,
            and gaps that are opportunities to be filled. Communities
            can define different clusters of resource flows within and in and out of the community, and analyze these.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is the one that connects to the whole ecosystem if you want it to.

            <h4>ValueFlows: Network interoperability</h4>
            <p>This is a project involving a number of people and software organizations who want to create open vocabulary
            and protocols so that next economy networks can inter-operate with each other. 
            We want to create a way for networks on different servers, and/or different software packages, 
            to talk the same language. 
            <p>
            With some other people, we've created a repository for working on this. We think this ongoing work
            has a lot of promise for creating ever-increasing networks of networks.

                <p>
                Chanterelles are mycorrhizal mushrooms.  (We would have used that as our name, but who can spell it?)
                </p>
                <p>
                Mycorrhizal mushrooms create networks underground, sometimes very large.  
                They form mutually beneficial relationships with plants, where the mycorrhizae help the plants get food 
                from the soil, and the plants help the mycorrhizae get food from the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                Back in the Devonian age, when ocean plants started to colonize the land, they would not have been 
                able to do so without forming relationships with mycorrhizal fungi that were already there.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Think of this as the Devonian age of the next economy.</b>

            <h4>How do we interconnect?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p> By means of conversations for action leading to cooperative
            transfers of resources: work, food, housing, tools, ideas, care - all the necessities of life.
            </p>
            <p>Conversations for action because people want to agree on their actions rather 
            than being commanded. Cooperative transfers of resources because cooperation makes us all 
            stronger while exploitation makes some stronger and some weaker and eventually all weaker. 
            Mutual coordination instead of command and control.
            </p>
            <p>Internetworked because cooperative economic networks will be stronger than competitive 
            individuals. By internetworking, we can pool ideas and resources, create things together, 
            and create regional economic ecosystems that can behave differently from capitalism.
            </p>
            <p>The details of internetworking are simple but evolve into complex systems.
            </p>
            <p>They are input-process-output networks, where the output resource of one process becomes 
            the input for another. Sometimes the resources are tangible, sometimes intangible.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The input-process-output networks can grow into economic ecosystems. That’s what we are trying to make happen: 
            connect all the similar but disconnected experiments toward a better economic system into an 
            actual real-life better economic system.
            </p>
            <p>Back in the 1990’s, when supply chain systems were rising, their motto was “the best supply 
            chain wins, not the best company”. Then the thinking broadened to the best value system, then 
            the best value network. Now it’s the best economic ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>But all of these formations under capitalism have a fatal flaw: all of the participants 
            in the ecosystem are trying to grab more of the value for themselves, which degrades the whole system. 
            </p>
            <p>And by ecosystem, we really mean ecosystem. The economic ecosystem is part of the whole 
            ecosystem. When any part of the ecosystem tries to grab more for itself at the expense of some 
            other part, it may weaken the whole system. The rule should be mutual benefit as much as possible. 
            If you degrade the soil, you will degrade the crops. If you degrade the crops, you will degrade 
            those who eat the crops. If you as a capitalist impoverish your workers, they will no longer 
            be able to buy your products. And so on.
