        <h3>Does your software do e-commerce?</h3>
        <p>
        No. This is "back-office" software, for running an economic organization. So far, people have enjoyed creating their own e-commerce
        sites, using the many open-source products that do that well. We might add that feature if anybody wants it and we think it can be done 
        better in some way.  
        </p>

        <h3>Does your software have [some other feature that it does not have]?</h3>
        <p>
        We only add features that an active user group wants. So if nobody wanted it so far, it does not have it. Beyond that, we are 
        constrained by time and skills. See next question, too.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Does your software do mobile?</h3>
        <p>
        No. The current programmers have never done that. Our software is all Web, and not mobile-friendly. We'd love to have somebody do that 
        who knows how. We'd provide APIs.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Your app is huge! Didn't you get the memo about Minimum Viable Product?</h3>
        <p>
        Yes, but we deleted it. We're doing Maximally Viable Project: all the features that our user groups need, to the best of our abilities. 
        And we're not doing a Product. See next question, too.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Even so, we need [some other feature that you do not have].</h3>
        <p>
        Two answers:  
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        We will never be able to do everything that is needed, but lots of people are doing related projects. We want to internetwork with them.
        </li>
        <li>
        It's all open source. Jump in, the water's fine!
        </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>So what are you actually trying to do? What's your focus?</h3>
        <p>
        We start from the stage where some group of people have decided to make something together that might bring them some income. 
        Then we try to track and coordinate all of their activities in making something, and distribute the income to the contributors.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>So where do the "human and ecological needs" fit into making something that might make some money?</h3>
        <p>
        We're living in a transitional stage, where people still need money to live. Open source projects often have lots of volunteer 
        contributions. Then some company makes money off the project, but does not give back to the contributors. We are trying to 
        fix that problem, so the income gets distributed democratically to all the contributors.   
        </p>
        <p>
        We're talking to another project, <a href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Netention">Netention</a>, 
        that is focused on registering human and ecological needs. We want to work with them 
        so that when some people in their software decide to do something together to meet some of those needs, 
        they can use our software to coordinate their activities. And then go back to Netention for the next needs. 
        They are both open source on the open Web, and we want to be able to move easily back and forth. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>What other related projects are you talking to?</h3>
        <p>
        As of May 2014: <a href="https://www.loomio.org/">Loomio</a> (about making better decisions together), 
        <a href="http://www.getlocal.coop/">Get Local</a> (a platform to support sustainable entrepreneurship in Irish communities), 
        and a few startups that are not up and running yet. We'll keep this list up-to-date.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Don't you know that the Web is for old geezers? The cool young things only use phones and apps.</h3>
        <p>
        Well, yeah, we do know that. But we are old geezers, and we've seen all this before. The Web will suck the phones and apps back in. 
        Everything must internetwork.  
        </p>
